# DogApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You will initially arrive at a list of dog breeds served by the Dog API through the [Node BFF for the application](https://github.com/jdbadilla/dog-app-bff).

If you click on one of the dog names, you will be redirected to a page containing additional details about the dog breed, such as an image and other related dog breeds (if applicable).

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
